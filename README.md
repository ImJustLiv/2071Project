Scaling affects the size and essentially mutliplies every coordinate and dimension by whatever the scale factor is
scaling larger makes the pixels larger so it might look more pixelated because of this
Rotation spins every point around the origin of a picture by an angle theta, so it looks like the entire thing was turned by a certain amount
Shearing pushes rows and columns more in one direction, so squares will become parallelograms or circles are ellipes in the shear direction
Reflection changes the symmetry by flipping points along the axis, there is a new symmetry since the reflected image is symmetrical but reflected as well by angle theta
